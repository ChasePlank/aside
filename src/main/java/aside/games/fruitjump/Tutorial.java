/**
 * The first nine levels are hand-built tutorials, not generated ones.
 *
 * Each teaches exactly one thing and shows it rather than saying it, in the
 * order the player needs it: move, fight, blast, shoot, deal with the bat,
 * know your items, know your enemies, know the ground, and know the water.
 * Level 9 ends the run back at the menu.
 *
 * THIS HEADER SAID "eight" AND "Level 8 ends the run" LONG AFTER LEVEL 9 EXISTED. Water was added as level 9 and
 * the count and the list were not revisited, so the claim was false in the file that DEFINES `LAST` - and the
 * check written to catch exactly this class of staleness did not see it, because it greps for the phrase
 * "ends at <N>" and this file says neither "ends at" nor a digit. Two spellings of the same claim, one covered.
 * A comment naming a value is a claim; a check that matches one phrasing of it is a check with a blind spot.
 *
 * Built PROGRAMMATICALLY from a flat floor plus placed entities rather than as
 * hand-written ASCII grids. Flat rooms are exactly the shape you should
 * generate - I have been consistently wrong about hand-placed grids, and these
 * have to be right because they are the first thing anyone plays.
