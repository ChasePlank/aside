/**
 * The first eight levels are hand-built tutorials, not generated ones.
 *
 * Each teaches exactly one thing and shows it rather than saying it, in the
 * order the player needs it: move, fight, blast, shoot, deal with the bat,
 * know your items, know your enemies, know the ground. Level 8 ends the run
 * back at the menu.
 *
 * Built PROGRAMMATICALLY from a flat floor plus placed entities rather than as
 * eight hand-written ASCII grids. Flat rooms are exactly the shape you should
 * generate - I have been consistently wrong about hand-placed grids, and these
 * have to be right because they are the first thing anyone plays.
