/**
 * Slope — a walkable inclined surface (height-function approach).
 *
 * The slope is a line segment from (x0,y0) to (x1,y1) — the walkable
 * surface, not a solid volume. Solid tiles underneath give the slope
 * its body; this class only answers one question: "how high is the
 * ground at x?"
 *
 * This sidesteps the hard problem of swept-AABB vs diagonal collision:
 * the AABB sweep handles all solid geometry, and the slope resolution
 * pass (in World) snaps feet to the surface height after the sweep.
 *
 * Steepness: |dy/dx| > STEEP_RATIO means the slope is too steep to
 * walk on — the body slides down instead of grounding.
