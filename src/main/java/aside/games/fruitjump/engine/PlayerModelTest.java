/**
 * The bot that proves levels are completable must model the same player the game runs.
 *
 * <p><b>WHY THIS EXISTS.</b> `GameplayScreen` carries the comment "Tuned constants (match the validator's verified
 * values)" over its RUN_SPEED and JUMP_V, and nothing checked it. `LevelValidator` - the blind-traversal bot that
 * provides the empirical half of the generator's "completable by construction" claim - keeps its own copy of both
 * numbers, because the engine cannot reach up into the screen layer that owns them.
 *
 * <p><b>THE FAILURE THIS PREVENTS IS SILENT.</b> Tune the player's jump and leave the bot's copy alone, and the bot
 * keeps clearing levels using velocities the game no longer has. The gate stays green, the level is valid by every
 * measure the project has, and the game is unclearable. Nothing about that is visible from any existing check.
 *
 * <p><b>THIS IS THE PARITY PATTERN AGAIN, one layer in:</b> the engine against the release, and now the bot's model
 * against the game. Two numbers that must agree, asserted rather than assumed, and the assertion is in the engine
 * package because that is where LevelValidator's constants can be read.
