/**
 * What a blast does to what is inside it, and to what is not.
 *
 * <p><b>WHY THIS EXISTS.</b> `tools/tautologies.py` reported that `Projectile.BLAST_DAMAGE_RANGE` could be set to
 * zero - switching the blast's damage off entirely - with nothing in 649 checks noticing. The class doc says
 * "Bombs: thrown arc, fuse timer, explosion radius damages enemies": the arc and the fuse were pinned, and the part
 * that makes a bomb a weapon rather than a wall-opener was not.
 *
 * <p><b>IT CALLS handleExplosion DIRECTLY</b>, which it can because it lives in this package - the same reason
 * CrackedPocketTest exists. That is not the layer-skipping mistake the arrow-versus-boss check made: this IS the
 * routing that decides who is in the blast, and the layer above it (the throw, the fuse, the landing collision) is
 * already pinned by the weapons block in SelfTest.
 *
 * <p><b>FIXED DISTANCES, NOT THE CONSTANT.</b> The far enemy is placed 160px away as a number the game ships with,
 * not as a multiple of BLAST_DAMAGE_RANGE, because a fixture computed from the constant moves with it and can never
 * fail - the tautology rule 32 is about, one level along. 160 is chosen to be comfortably outside the shipped 100
 * and comfortably inside what a doubled radius would be, so it catches both "off" and "twice as big".
