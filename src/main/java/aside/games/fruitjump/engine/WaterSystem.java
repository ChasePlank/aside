/**
 * WaterSystem - everything water does to a body, and everything the game
 * needs to know about it.
 *
 * Split from {@link Water} on purpose: Water is the level's geometry (pure
 * queries, freely shareable), this is per-body state and per-frame response.
 *
 * The frame order matters and mirrors World.step:
 *
 *   applyMedium(b, dt)   BEFORE gravity. Returns true when water has already
 *                        accounted for vertical motion (swimming), so gravity
 *                        must NOT be added on top - buoyancy and gravity in
 *                        the same frame would double-count and make swimming
 *                        feel either leaden or floaty depending on depth.
 *   ...body moves and collides...
 *   postStep(b, dt)      AFTER the move. Recomputes state at the new position,
 *                        fires the splash on a surface crossing, and runs the
 *                        breath meter. Splash detection lives here rather than
 *                        in applyMedium because the crossing happens DURING
 *                        the move: the pre-move position is dry, the post-move
 *                        position is wet, and only the comparison of the two
 *                        says "that was an entry".
 *
 * Bodies are keyed by identity (Physics.Body has no equals), so a body that
 * is removed simply drops out of the map.
