/**
 * AI Director — L4D-style pacing system that watches player performance
 * and adjusts spawn intensity in real time. The "game feels alive" layer.
 *
 * States:
 *   BUILD   — intensity rising, spawns throttled to build tension
 *   PEAK    — max intensity, full spawns, the climax
 *   RELAX   — backing off, reduced spawns, player catches breath
 *   RECOVER — mercy window, minimal spawns, player recovers
 *
 * Key signals:
 *   intensity    — how hard the game is pushing right now (0-1)
 *   frustration  — EMA of player struggles (damage taken, near misses)
 *   performance  — how well the player is doing (kills, accuracy)
 *
 * The director adjusts spawn rates based on these signals, creating
 * dynamic pacing that adapts to player skill in real time.
