/**
 * Three things the piranha's comments claim and nothing was checking.
 *
 * <p><b>WHY THIS EXISTS.</b> `tools/tautologies.py` reported that `IDLE_SPEED`, `RECOVER_TIME` and `HIT_COOLDOWN`
 * could each be switched off with nothing in ~9976 checks noticing. The class doc makes claims about all three - a
 * fish that idles at its pool and only moves when you are in the water, a punish window after a miss, and a bite
 * that costs it time - and none of the claims had a check.
 *
 * <p><b>THE FIXTURE IS WaterEnemyTest'S POOL, reused rather than reinvented</b>: a 4-deep pool in a walled box with
 * dry ground either side. Same reason the blast test calls the pocket test's shape - two fixtures for one level
 * layout is two things to keep in step.
 *
 * <p><b>AND ONE FINDING THAT IS NOT A CHECK.</b> `HIT_COOLDOWN` is real - setting it to 1000 took the bite count in
 * ten seconds from four to one - but at its shipped 0.6 it cannot do anything, because re-engagement is gated by
 * `REAGGRO_DELAY` (2.5s) and any cooldown shorter than that has already expired by the time the fish comes back.
 * That is why zero is invisible: it is inert at this value, not untested. Left in place and reported rather than
 * deleted, because removing a guard is a design decision - but worth knowing, since the class already removed one
 * knob that looked load-bearing and did nothing.

     * on two of three seeds: the fish's centre reaches about y=131, three pixels above the surface line at y=128. What
     * it is actually doing is drifting at the surface with its body straddling the waterline, which is what a fish
     * does - the centre is a point, the fish is 16px tall, and submersion is what matters. So the assertion asks the
