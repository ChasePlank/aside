/**
 * Water - a level's water field: geometry and queries only, no per-body state.
 *
 * Water is never added to collision, so it can never fight the swept AABB
 * pass. Everything water does to a body is a FORCE, applied before movement
 * by {@link WaterSystem}. That separation is deliberate: a body resting in
 * water generates no collision (tEntry=0 is rejected by the sweep), so any
 * water behavior routed through collision-response would silently never fire
 * for a floating body - the same trap the moving-platform carry fell into.
 *
 * The field is a boolean mask over the level's tile grid rather than a list
 * of rectangles, which buys two things rects cannot give:
 *
 *   - a per-column surface: the top of the contiguous water run containing
 *     the query point, so two pools stacked in one column each report their
 *     own surface instead of both reporting the upper one;
 *   - a real depth per column, which is what separates WADING from SWIMMING.
 *     Depth is the honest signal: a one-tile puddle is shallow no matter how
 *     much of the body it covers, and a body standing on the floor of a
 *     three-tile pool is deep no matter where its feet are.
 *
 * Merged rectangles are still built ({@link #rects}) for rendering.
