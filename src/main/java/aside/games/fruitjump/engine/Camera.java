     * logical view). The high-res canvas is 1600x1200 PHYSICAL pixels.
     * worldToScreen is the only place that conversion belongs: every
     * draw call feeds the result straight to the GraphicsContext and
     * multiplies SIZES by the same factor, so positions and sizes stay
     * in the same space.
     *
     * This is what was missing. The camera was built with a PHYSICAL
     * viewport (1600x1200) but handed LOGICAL room bounds (1920x448),
     * so the room read as far shorter than the view; the vertical
     * clamp had no room to scroll and pinned the camera, and the whole
     * level rendered at 1x in the top 448px of a 1200px window. Sprites
     * were still drawn at 2x on top of those 1x positions, so every
     * sprite sat half a tile off its own collision box -- the door read
     * as sunk a tile into the floor, pickups sat off-centre, the exit
     * floated. One missing multiply.
