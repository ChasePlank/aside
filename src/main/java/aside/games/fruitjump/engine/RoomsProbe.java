/**
 * What does ROOMS MODE contain, and does the mode load everything it generates?
 *
 * <p><b>THIS EXISTS BECAUSE THE TWO MODES ARE NOT THE SAME GAME, AND NOTHING SAID SO.</b> The scrolling platformer
 * contains water, spikes, cracked floors, one-way planks, moving platforms, four enemy kinds and a boss. Rooms mode
 * - the screen-transition architecture the Scratch project was built around, and the one this game is headed for -
 * contains enemies, pickups and doors, and nothing else. There is no water, no hazard of any kind, no platform that
 * moves, and no boss.
 *
 * <p><b>AND THAT IS A STAGE RATHER THAN A FAULT, which is why this is a report and not a check.</b> The loader and
 * the generator agree exactly: `RoomsScreen.loadRoom` adds tiles, one-ways, enemies, pickups and doors, and
 * `RoomWorld` generates enemies, pickups and doors and nothing else. Nothing is generated and dropped - the mode
 * simply has less, deliberately or not.
 *
 * <p>What it is for is the day somebody grows rooms mode: this prints the inventory so the change is visible, and
 * `aside/tools/compare-release.sh` makes the same kind of statement about this repository against the release.
 *
 * <p><b>AND IT IS A CHECK AS WELL AS A REPORT, because the gate's tool list says every tool in it is a check and a
 * check that cannot fail is worse than no check.</b> What it asserts is the invariant that would be invisible if it
 * broke: every content map this mode generates has SOMETHING in it. A door generator that stopped placing doors
 * would leave a mode that still runs, still loads, and is missing its doors. The thresholds are one room in five
 * seeds - the doors are genuinely rare at 4 in 125 - so the check is about a generator that has stopped, not about
 * a number that moved.
 *
 * <p>What it does NOT assert is the one-way count, which is zero and correctly so: see the note it prints.
