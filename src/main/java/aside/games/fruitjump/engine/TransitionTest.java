/**
 * A room transition takes about a third of a second, and it does end.
 *
 * <p><b>FOUND BY tools/tautologies.py:</b> `ScreenManager.TRANSITION_TIME` could be set to anything with nothing
 * noticing - the last unwatched constant the sweep could reach. It is the fade between rooms in Rooms mode, which is
 * the architecture the real game is being built towards, and both of its failure modes are player-visible: a
 * transition of zero frames is a hard cut where the room changes before anyone can see it happen, and one that never
 * ends is a game that has stopped responding.
 *
 * <p><b>Both bounds, and the room change is asserted too</b> - a timer that counts down correctly while the player
 * stays in the old room would pass a duration check and be useless.
