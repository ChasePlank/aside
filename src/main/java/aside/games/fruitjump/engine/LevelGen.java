/**
 * LevelGen - procedural platformer levels in the LevelMap ASCII format.
 *
 * Approach: a ground random walk (the guaranteed path) plus SOLID
 * TERRAIN beneath it. The walk carves a floor with bounded jumps and
 * bounded climbs:
 *   - horizontal gaps <= MAX_GAP_CELLS (jumpable)
 *   - vertical steps up <= MAX_STEP_CELLS (jumpable)
 *   - drops can be any height (falling is free)
 * and the level then ASCENDS to the exit on a staircase of 2-cell
 * climbs.
 *
 * Every generated level is completable BY CONSTRUCTION; the validator
 * bot exists to prove it empirically.

        // inside, and the vault's own comment explains why it did not use a floor hole: "the player

        //
        // TWO cells wide, not one. One cell is spanned by the lips and can never be entered.
        //
        // WHY THE SEAT IS ONE CELL: the bombed hole is the second cell of air. A pocket H cells tall
        // has its floor one row below that, so climbing straight out is H+1 cells; the body is 44px
        // and a cell is 32px, so H must be at least 2 to fit inside at all - which makes the climb
        // 3 cells = 96px against a 73px jump. There is no H that works: the door has to be the hole.
        // Hence one cell of seat plus the open hole above it (64px of air, the body fits with its head
        // poking up) and a floor two rows down, which is a 2-cell climb = 64px, inside the jump with
        // the same margin the walk's own step limit assumes.
        //
        // Placed after the enemy and bat passes because both look for wide flat stretches of path,
        // and a bombable floor is not a stretch to stand on. It writes its own floor: the terrain
        // mass above filled below the walk, but a pocket carved into that fill would otherwise have
