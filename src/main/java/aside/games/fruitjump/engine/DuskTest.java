 * The sun goes down over the run, and the run ends when it has.
 *
 * <p><b>FOUND BY A MUTATION NOTHING NOTICED.</b> `LevelGen.FINAL_LEVEL` from 40 to 2 - a run of two levels instead
 * of forty - came back NOT CAUGHT from every suite, and the run's length is load-bearing: the code's own comment
 * says "AND THIS IS THE WAY HOME. The run has a length and its end is the dusk - the sun the whole climb has been
 * sinking towards." Nothing asserted that the sun is anywhere near down when the game decides you are home.
 *
 * <p><b>RELATIONAL, NOT A CONSTANT.</b> Comparing `LEVELS_TO_DUSK` to `FINAL_LEVEL` would be a tautology - one is
 * defined as the other - and would catch nothing. What is asserted is the SHAPE of the descent: it starts in
 * daylight, it arrives at night, and it gets there by sinking rather than by jumping.
