/**
 * Does the generator actually produce water - and is it the shape it was built to be?
 *
 * Counting, not reading, is how the release found that three rows of water plus a pool floor never fit in the
 * map and it silently flooded nothing. Counting is also how the upstream port found that every flooded gap in
 * every level was ONE row of water sitting on a row of spikes: the gap-pit pass wrote '^' over the water's
 * second row, and the pool floor under it. The cell count said 17 across 40 levels where two rows over four
 * pools is 34.
 *
 * So the count alone is not enough - it says how much water there is, not whether it is a pool. The shape check
 * below asserts what the flood pass claims to build: every water run is exactly two cells tall with a solid
 * floor under it, and no water cell has a spike in it. That is the check that would have caught the original
 * bug from the number alone, and it is the check that will catch it if the two passes ever disagree again.
 *
 * Not a copy of the release's probe: aside's LevelGen has no forLevel(int) factory, it takes constructor
 * arguments, so this is written against this API.
 *
 * It probes the GAME's geometry, and it says so in its own output. The first version used 60x14 - a height
 * copied from an older comment rather than from the level the game builds, which is 60x20 (GameplayScreen's
 * LEVEL_W/LEVEL_H). Here the answer happened to be the same either way, which is exactly what makes a
 * mismatched probe dangerous: it is one generation change away from reporting a number about a map nobody
 * plays, and nothing in the output would have said so. Printing the geometry is the cheap half of that fix.
