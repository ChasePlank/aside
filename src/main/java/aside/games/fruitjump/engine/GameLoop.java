 * Fixed timestep game loop for deterministic physics.

 * Solution: accumulate time, step physics at fixed intervals.
 * This ensures identical behavior at 30fps, 60fps, or 144fps.
 *
 * The loop:
 *   - Accumulate elapsed time
 *   - While accumulator >= dt, step physics
 *   - Render with interpolation between states

     * comment. This constant, which explains itself, was used only by {@link #run}, where the frame time is always
     * DT and the clamp can therefore never fire. So the documented copy was dead in its own path and the live copy
     * was an unexplained number in another file, which is where a drift between them would start.
     *
     * <p>The screen uses this constant now, so the two cannot disagree, and {@link #advance} gives the engine a path
     * where the clamp is reachable and therefore testable - it was unreachable from any suite before.
