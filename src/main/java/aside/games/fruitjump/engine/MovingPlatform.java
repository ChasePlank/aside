/**
 * Kinematic moving platform: moves on a path, carries the player.
 * 
 * Kinematic = moved by code, not forces. The platform ignores gravity and
 * collisions with tiles; it follows a fixed path. The player collides with
 * it as if it were solid geometry.
 * 
 * The carry mechanic: when the player is standing on the platform, the
 * platform's velocity is added to the player's movement each frame.
 * This is how real platformers do it — the player doesn't "stick" to
 * the platform, they just inherit its velocity while grounded on it.
