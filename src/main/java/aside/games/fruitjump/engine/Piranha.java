/**
 * A fish that lives in the water and bites.
 *
 * <p>Kinger's ask, verbatim: "a new enemy, piranha, like bats, but does hurt instead of stun, and spawn in
 * groups". The bat is the model and the differences are the point:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>It hurts, it does not stun.</b> A bat knocks you down and you get up; a piranha takes a heart. That
 *       makes it the only water threat, and it means water stops being the safe landing a missed jump used to
 *       get - which is the whole reason water was rare enough to be harmless before.
 *   <li><b>It only moves when YOU are in the water.</b> A fish out of water is not a threat and should not
 *       pretend to be one, so it idles at its pool and chases only when the player is swimming. That is also
 *       what makes the surface a decision rather than a wall: get out and it loses you.
 *   <li><b>Slower than the player's swim.</b> 95 against a swim that crosses a pool in a moment - it cannot
 *       catch you in open water, only corner you, which is what a group is for.
 *   <li><b>In groups.</b> Placed three to five at once in one pool, so the threat is the pool, not the fish.
 * </ul>
