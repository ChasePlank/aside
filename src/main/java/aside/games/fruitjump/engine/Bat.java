/**
 * Bat - a flying pursuer that cannot hurt you, only knock you down.
 *
 * Design intent (Kinger, Sept 29): the bat FOLLOWS, and the follow is
 * abusable ON PURPOSE. The player can lead it away from a gap, or bait its
 * dive and then move. That makes the bat positioning play - the player uses
 * it - rather than just another timed jump. Bats CAN engage over gaps; there
 * is no placement restriction, and the reason that is fair is that gaps are
 * climbable spike pits, so a mid-air knockover is a setback and not a death.
 *
 * THE CONSTANT THAT MAKES THE LURE EXIST
 * PURSUE_SPEED must stay BELOW the player's run speed (200). A bat that can
 * outrun the player is a chase, not a tool - you cannot lead something that
 * simply catches you. Flying is what makes it threatening at that speed: it
 * ignores terrain, so it does not need to be fast to be dangerous.
 *
 * THE FAIR PART
 * Once a swoop starts the dive vector is FIXED - it cannot steer. So a
 * committed dive can be baited into empty space, and a missed dive costs it
 * a recovery window before it can pursue again. That is the punish.
 *
 * The knockover does not remove the bat; it makes it disengage. That retreat
 * is load-bearing twice over: it stops a non-damaging stun becoming a
 * stun-lock, and it is what creates the cycle the player re-lures.
