/**
 * The platformer's sound backend: turns posted cue names into sound.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this is a separate class.</b> {@code AudioSystem} posts events and knows nothing about JavaFX -
 * that split is deliberate and worth keeping, because the engine runs headless in the gate and on a machine
 * with no sound device. This is the other half: it reads the names and plays the files.
 *
 * <p><b>Why it lives in {@code games/fruitjump/} and not next to the screens.</b> The screens are "wiring"
 * files that the release sync skips, so a backend written there would have to be written twice and would drift.
 * A file here travels with the sync, and it can, because it does not import {@code aside.ui.*} - it talks to
 * JavaFX directly. That is the same reason {@code CharacterConfig} and {@code WaterSuite} live here.
 *
 * <p>Nothing about this is load-bearing for the game: with no audio folder every cue is silently skipped, and
 * the platformer plays exactly as it did before it had sound.
